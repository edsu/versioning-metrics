This is a little utility to compare version control systems, the 
space they use, the time it takes to commit, etc.

To use it you'll need to create a data directory with arbitrary 
files in it. Put a bunch of mp3 files in there, or a bunch of text
files, or whatever you want.

After that you should be able to run:

  compare.py

and see some numbers for how much space the various repositories take up,
how long it takes to modifications, etc.

You'll need to have python, git, mercurial and dflat [1] installed, and be on
a Unix system. Dflat is a utility that's on PyPI, which you should be able
to install with:

  easy_install dflat
